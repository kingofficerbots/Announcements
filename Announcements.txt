(In Greek terms 11.10.2024)
_______________________________

Many people may think that we are not busy, 
but we are. We are developing something that's
gonna change a shop order system for Zep's Graphics. 

Now you are gonna ask us " How? "

Some things will need Specific PERMISSIONS to open. 
Like the ticket manage button, selected with user only IDs. The currently selected users are developers and Zepstro. 


That's a small leak. Wait for more ðŸ˜‰
